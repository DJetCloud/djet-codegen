        This exchange specification is based on generally agreed common requirements across healthcare - covering many jurisdictions, domains, and different functional approaches. It is common for specific implementations to have valid requirements that are not part of these agreed common requirements. Incorporating all valid requirements would make this specification very cumbersome and difficult to implement. Instead, this specification expects that additional valid requirements will be implemented as extensions.

        As such, extensibility is a fundamental part of the design of this specification. Every element in a resource can have extension child elements to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. Applications should not reject resources merely because they contain extensions, though they may need to reject resources because of the specific contents of the extensions.

        Note that, unlike in many other specifications, there can be no stigma associated with the use of extensions by any application, project, or standard - regardless of the institution or jurisdiction that uses or defines the extensions. The use of extensions is what allows the FHIR specification to retain a core simplicity for everyone.

        To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is strict governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Although any implementer can define and use extensions, there is a set of requirements that must be met as part of their use and definition.

        The base definition for all elements contained inside a resource. All elements, whether defined as a Data Type (including primitives) or as part of a resource structure, have this base content:

        Extensions
        An internal id
        There are 3 kinds of descendent types that specialize Element:

        Primitive data types, that add a primitive value property of the specified type
        Complex data types, that add their own children (all of which are also elements)
        BackboneElement, A specialization that adds modifierExtension, which is the super-type of all the element types defined in resource definitions (e.g. Patient.contact)
        Note that resources themselves all specialize the base type Resource.

        Any resource that is a DomainResource (almost all types of resource) may include a human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be used to represent the content of the resource to a human.

        If narrative is present with a status other than 'empty', it SHALL reflect all content needed for a human to understand the essential clinical and business information for the resource. In other words, it must be safe to render only the narrative of the resource without displaying any of the resource's discrete/encoded information. Resource definitions and/or profiles on resources may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        The narrative for a resource can contain additional information that is not in the structured data, including human-edited content. Such additional information SHALL be in the scope of the definition of the resource, though it is common for the narrative to include additional descriptive information extracted from other referenced resources when describing references. Narrative for a resource should include summary information about any referenced resources that would be required for a consumer of the resource to be able to understand the key, essential information about a resource without retrieving any additional resources.

        For example, the narrative for a MedicationRequest might include brief summary information about the referenced patient, prescriber and medication. Some resources (e.g. List, Composition) may provide specific rules about what content must (or must not) be included in the resource narrative. Consideration should be given to the fact that referenced resources may be updated without updating referencing resources, so the proportion of content of a referenced resource included in a referencing resource should be limited. Systems MAY choose how narrative is generated, including how much de-referencing to perform, but SHALL NOT assume that the resource is rendered in any particular context when generating narrative.

            Logical id of this artifact.
            Each resource has an "id" element which contains the logical identity of the resource assigned by the server responsible for storing it. Resources always have a known identity except for the special case when a new resource is being sent to a server to assign an identity (create interaction). The logical identity is unique within the space of all resources of the same type on the same server. Once assigned, the identity is never changed. Note that if the resource is copied to another server, the copy might not be able to retain the same logical identity.

            The unique identifier of a resource instance is an absolute URI constructed from the server base address at which the instance is found, the resource type and the Logical ID, such as http://test.fhir.org/rest/Patient/123 (where 123 is the Logical Id). When the literal identity is an HTTP address, this address can generally be used to retrieve or manipulate the resource. Note that implementations SHOULD NOT assume that the identity of a resource is always resolvable to a literal server - it may be temporarily unavailable, or not available by policy (e.g. firewalls) or in some cases, it might not actually exist (e.g. use of resource outside a RESTful environment). Resources reference each other by their identity. These references are allowed to be absolute or relative (see Resource References for further discussion). Copying or moving resources from one server to another means that resources acquire a new identity. For further details, see Managing Resource Identity (including "Consistent Resource Identification").

            Logical ids (and therefore literal identities) are case sensitive. Logical Ids are always opaque, and external systems need not and should not attempt to determine their internal structure. A logical id SHALL always be represented in the same way in resource references and URLs. Ids can be up to 64 characters long, and contain any combination of upper and lowercase ASCII letters, numerals, "-" and ".".

            A set of rules under which this content was created.

            A reference to a custom agreement that describes how the resource is being used (e.g. an implementation guide) that was followed when the resource was constructed, where the implemenation guide must be known and understood in order to safely processing the content.

            Asserting this rule set restricts the content to be only understood by a limited set of trading partners. This inherently limits the usefulness of the data in the long term, and should be avoided where possible. However, the existing health eco-system is highly fractured, and not yet ready to define, collect, and exchange data in a generally exchangeable sense.

            Note that resources are almost always constructed following some custom agreement. Best practice - which is recommended throughout the conformance resources - is that such agreements make all knowledge about the content of the resource explicit in the content of the resource; if custom agreements follow this advice, and declare their extensions as required, then it is not necessary to understand the agreement in order to safely process the resource content. For this reason, use of implicitRules is rare.

        This specification defines a series of different types of resource that can be used to exchange and/or store data in order to solve a wide range of healthcare related problems, both clinical and administrative. In addition, this specification defines several different ways of exchanging the resources.

        A resource is an entity that:

        has a known identity (a URL) by which it can be addressed
        identifies itself as one of the types of resource defined in this specification
        contains a set of structured data items as described by the definition of the resource type
        has an identified version that changes if the contents of the resource change

            Logical id of this artifact.
            Each resource has an "id" element which contains the logical identity of the resource assigned by the server responsible for storing it. Resources always have a known identity except for the special case when a new resource is being sent to a server to assign an identity (create interaction). The logical identity is unique within the space of all resources of the same type on the same server. Once assigned, the identity is never changed. Note that if the resource is copied to another server, the copy might not be able to retain the same logical identity.

            The unique identifier of a resource instance is an absolute URI constructed from the server base address at which the instance is found, the resource type and the Logical ID, such as http://test.fhir.org/rest/Patient/123 (where 123 is the Logical Id). When the literal identity is an HTTP address, this address can generally be used to retrieve or manipulate the resource. Note that implementations SHOULD NOT assume that the identity of a resource is always resolvable to a literal server - it may be temporarily unavailable, or not available by policy (e.g. firewalls) or in some cases, it might not actually exist (e.g. use of resource outside a RESTful environment). Resources reference each other by their identity. These references are allowed to be absolute or relative (see Resource References for further discussion). Copying or moving resources from one server to another means that resources acquire a new identity. For further details, see Managing Resource Identity (including "Consistent Resource Identification").

            Logical ids (and therefore literal identities) are case sensitive. Logical Ids are always opaque, and external systems need not and should not attempt to determine their internal structure. A logical id SHALL always be represented in the same way in resource references and URLs. Ids can be up to 64 characters long, and contain any combination of upper and lowercase ASCII letters, numerals, "-" and ".".

            A set of rules under which this content was created.

            A reference to a custom agreement that describes how the resource is being used (e.g. an implementation guide) that was followed when the resource was constructed, where the implemenation guide must be known and understood in order to safely processing the content.

            Asserting this rule set restricts the content to be only understood by a limited set of trading partners. This inherently limits the usefulness of the data in the long term, and should be avoided where possible. However, the existing health eco-system is highly fractured, and not yet ready to define, collect, and exchange data in a generally exchangeable sense.

            Note that resources are almost always constructed following some custom agreement. Best practice - which is recommended throughout the conformance resources - is that such agreements make all knowledge about the content of the resource explicit in the content of the resource; if custom agreements follow this advice, and declare their extensions as required, then it is not necessary to understand the agreement in order to safely process the resource content. For this reason, use of implicitRules is rare.

        A domain resource is an resource that:
        has a human-readable XHTML representation of the content of the resource (see Human Narrative in resources)
        can contain additional related resources inside the resource (see Contained Resources)
        can have additional extensions and modifierExtensions as well as the defined data (See Extensibility)
        As an abstract resource, this resource is never created directly; instead, one of its descendent resources (see List of Resources) is created.
